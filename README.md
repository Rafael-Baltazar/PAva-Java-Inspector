Java Inspector
===================
The Java Inspector is a command line application to inspect Java code.

It can be started from any point of a Java program, accepting as argument an object to be inspected.
It enables access to the inspected object's classes, fields and methods.

Using Java Inspector:
---------------------
The Java Inspector must be started using the following form: new ist.meic.pa.Inspector().inspect(object)

Once the inspect method is called, it starts a read-eval-print loop in the console.
During the read-eval-print loop, you can print a list with the available console commands, using the "help" command.
